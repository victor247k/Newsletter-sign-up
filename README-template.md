## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library // tried and got pretty far, but then I switched back to normal html and js
- JS
- Writing this README file
- Making the repository 

### What I learned

I have learnt how to code a pretty good form that actually gets you to another page, and how to style it. How to display on a another page the result of the form using js.

```html
<form action="results.html" method="get">
  <label for="email">Email address</label>
  <input name="name" type="email" required placeholder="email@company.com" id="email">
  <button type="submit" id="submit">Subscribe to monthly  newsletter<button>
</form>
```
```css
ul {
    list-style: none;
}
```
```js
const span = document.getElementById('emailText');
new URLSearchParams(window.location.search).forEach((value, name) => {
    span.textContent = `${value}`
})
```

### Continued development

I need to get better at styling, how to be more efficient and make stuff look good, I still have a lot of html to learn, and a lot of javascript.
